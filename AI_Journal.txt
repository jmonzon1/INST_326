Week  1
Durring this first week of class I actually did not have much direct experience with. I was not able to attend this week's lab 
so I had to google how to create a txt file in github. I utilized the AI suggestion to learn how to create one and edit one on
github.

My only other experience with AI was whening talking to a friend who prompted ChatGPT about a what chocolate bar was prefered. 
I was arguing that the consensus prefers Reesee's, while he argued Snickers was better. I was right.

Week 2

This week I utilized ChatGPT to brainstorm topics related to Information Retrieval and Analysis Tool for the team project charter.
It gave us a couple ideas including social media trends, financial market analysis, and the one we agreed upon, health misinformation
tracker.

I also updated to IOS 26, so I have been messing around with apple AI to see what is new. In one of the discussion responese,
a classmate mentioned using AI to translate, so I started asking apple AI to translate certain sentences to see how good it was. 
It worked fine and did not struggle to translate. I also used to camera and started taking pictures of different things.
I asked things such as who's playing after taking a picture of my tv, and who is this while pointing at one of my Dragon Ball figures.

Week 3
Slow week for AI, I tried using apple AI to find a Canes that was on my route but it did not give me anything. I was dissapointed because
I was hoping the feature would be able to facilitate changing routes while driving. Im not sure what could have been the issue, it might have 
not have been on the AIs end. Maybe the AI feature is not compatible with my car or it didnt hear me.

Week 4 
Ive noticed that a lot of broadcaster now utilize AI for in game statisitics and graphics. One of the ones I 
frequently notice is Microsofts copilot durring La Liga. It was used specifically for the heatmaps and to show 
where the palyer's attacking lanes. 

For one of the lab questions, I could not figure out why I kept failing the check. I utilized ChatGPT to check my code first and 
then the check here: https://chatgpt.com/c/68dd3cc5-75b0-8331-9418-994ab7c7691b. I learned that there was not anything wrong with my 
code and that the check was a little off. I did not adjust the code.
