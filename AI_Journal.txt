Week  1
Durring this first week of class I actually did not have much direct experience with. I was not able to attend this week's lab 
so I had to google how to create a txt file in github. I utilized the AI suggestion to learn how to create one and edit one on
github.

My only other experience with AI was whening talking to a friend who prompted ChatGPT about a what chocolate bar was prefered. 
I was arguing that the consensus prefers Reesee's, while he argued Snickers was better. I was right.
