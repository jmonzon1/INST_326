Week  1
Durring this first week of class I actually did not have much direct experience with. I was not able to attend this week's lab 
so I had to google how to create a txt file in github. I utilized the AI suggestion to learn how to create one and edit one on
github.

My only other experience with AI was whening talking to a friend who prompted ChatGPT about a what chocolate bar was prefered. 
I was arguing that the consensus prefers Reesee's, while he argued Snickers was better. I was right.

Week 2

This week I utilized ChatGPT to brainstorm topics related to Information Retrieval and Analysis Tool for the team project charter.
It gave us a couple ideas including social media trends, financial market analysis, and the one we agreed upon, health misinformation
tracker.

I also updated to IOS 26, so I have been messing around with apple AI to see what is new. In one of the discussion responese,
a classmate mentioned using AI to translate, so I started asking apple AI to translate certain sentences to see how good it was. 
It worked fine and did not struggle to translate. I also used to camera and started taking pictures of different things.
I asked things such as who's playing after taking a picture of my tv, and who is this while pointing at one of my Dragon Ball figures.

Week 3
Slow week for AI, I tried using apple AI to find a Canes that was on my route but it did not give me anything. I was dissapointed because
I was hoping the feature would be able to facilitate changing routes while driving. Im not sure what could have been the issue, it might have 
not have been on the AIs end. Maybe the AI feature is not compatible with my car or it didnt hear me.

Week 4 
Ive noticed that a lot of broadcaster now utilize AI for in game statisitics and graphics. One of the ones I 
frequently notice is Microsofts copilot durring La Liga. It was used specifically for the heatmaps and to show 
where the palyer's attacking lanes. 

For one of the lab questions, I could not figure out why I kept failing the check. I utilized ChatGPT to check my code first and 
then the check here: https://chatgpt.com/c/68dd3cc5-75b0-8331-9418-994ab7c7691b. I learned that there was not anything wrong with my 
code and that the check was a little off. I did not adjust the code.

Week 5
I noticed that Spotify started recommending playlists “powered by AI,” so I tried one out. The music selection actually matched my usual taste really
well, which surprised me. I think it’s cool how AI can learn your preferences over time and adapt to them. I also noticed YouTube automatically 
generating video summaries and chapter titles, which made finding highlights from soccer games easier.

I used ChatGPT to double-check some of my Python code before submitting the lab. Its helpful for understanding how to improve instead of just copying an answer. 
I also experimented with Grammarly’s AI editor to polish a short writing assignment. It made the writing clearer without really changing my tone, which I liked.

Week 6
I asked ChatGPT to summarize an article I read last week in order to get a quick refresher: https://chatgpt.com/c/68fb80ba-3320-8325-9ac2-4467ad717f65. The 
article is from INST366, and talks about how social games like farmville mine players' data. I read it before fall break and just needed to be reminded on the 
key points.

Week 7
Little AI utilized this week. Sampling bias came up in one of my other classes and got me wondering how good AI was in languages other than english. 
As a result, I tested ChaptGPT by typing in spanish: https://chatgpt.com/c/6904ec5f-812c-8329-80c2-89519510a70a. I just asked it to write a program 
that calculates the area of a cube. The response seemed concise enough but Spanish is still such a big langauge. I wonder how it would handle other 
languages or dialects that are not seen as much online.

Week 8
I was struggling a bit with SQL aggregate functions, I utilized Claude to help me debug:https://claude.ai/share/b0ba056a-1b73-4748-962c-51625a374a65.
I noticed my error, I was focuisng on the wrong table and struggling to finde how to link primary keys. Claude helped me pretty efficiently, I used the
example as reference for the other questions.

I also noticed after updating my office that onenote offers a lot more autofill. I assume it is AI and is more intrusive than helpful. It does have an
option to turn it off as well.
